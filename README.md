# DBDLobby-Halloween2017
Full recreation (1:1) of the Halloween 2017 Lobby in Dead by Daylight

V1.01 of the Halloween 2017 mod is available in the Releases tab (.pak file) <br>
2 versions are available: Shadows ENABLED and Shadows DISABLED <br>

**NOTE** you may not be able to tell because it works so well, <br>
but this lobby is currently using 3.0.0 TallGrass vegetations & <br>
the 3.0.0 cammpfire mesh/blueprint. I might change this in the <br> 
future but its unlikely because it looks good and works well.

UE project will possibly be released at a later date.

**Credits:**

**Oleg / Олег Шабунов#6272 - creating template project, updating SDKs, materials & helping fix bugs/issues. (this would literally be impossible without him.)** <br>

**Pax - Recreating all components/aspects of the 1.8.0 lobby 1:1 in Unreal Engine**
